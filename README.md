Throughout our journey in the hackathon, our primary challenge was our lack of experience with app development. For most of our team, this was the first time working with react, expo, and firebase. Having never touched Javascript, we were presented with a steep learning curve to overcome.  
Our most significant challenges included storing data on Firebase and quality-of-life features on apps. While most of us had no experience with databases, we understood conceptually how a database worked but came to realize implementing it was a different story. Combined with the lack of sleep and time, we were able to pull through and deliver.
